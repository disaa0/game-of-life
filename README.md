# Conway's Game of Life
This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was invented by John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead, and evolves according to a set of rules based on the number of neighboring cells that are alive.

In this implementation, you can add and remove cells by clicking and dragging the mouse on the grid. Press the spacebar to start the simulation, and press R to reset the grid and start over.

# Installation and Usage
To run this game, you'll need Python 3 and Pygame installed on your system. To install Pygame, you can use pip:

``pip install pygame``

Once you have Pygame installed, you can run the game with:

``python app.py``

# Controls
- Click and drag to add or remove cells
- Press spacebar to start or stop the simulation
- Press R to reset the grid
